When Apache times out during long searches (past the timeout value specifies in
httpd.conf) no error is returned to the browser. If your searches seem to just
die, look in /var/log/httpd/error_log for a "timeout" entry.

Very large searches seem to fail, regardless of httpd.conf timeout setting.

Under some browsers/conditions, subsequent search.cgi forms are pre-populated
with the wrong year/month fields. 1999 (lowest value) seems to be a favorite.

Binary output only works in tcpdump searches.

Need a search progress indicator that works.

When graphing, any gap in datapoints should be padded with zeros for each 
unused x-axis increment. Example:
        00:01:00        100
        00:01:01        20
        00:01:02        0
        00:01:03        0
        00:01:04        0
        00:01:05        20
        00:01:06        0
        00:01:07        0
        00:01:08        20
        00:01:09        11
Without the zeros, the range from 01:01 - 01:08 would appear to be a continuous
rate. Plot using impulses or linespoints for a more accurate representation.
        
A binary or graphical output search, with the same query specified as a previous 
search, should be re-run if the datasets have changed. It isn't.

The statistics pages are not right.  Gotta fix them.
