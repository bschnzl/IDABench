<P>Welcome!

<P>IDABench is a pluggable framework for intrusion analysis. Network traffic is
captured on one or more sensor systems, then securely copied to a central
analyzer for detailed scrutiny on an hourly and ad-hoc basis. Libpcap-based
tools, such as tcpdump and ngrep, are called to examine the captured network
traffic against sets of predefined filters. As events of interest are
identified, either within IDABench or otherwise, historical packet records can
be queried for details of previously unreported activity.  Unlike most
rule-based intrusion detection systems, the lack of a matching rule (filter)
only affects the hourly report; the original network traffic crossing a
sensor's field of view is stored for later review.
<P>
<P>IDABench is NOT intended to be an intrusion detection system, although it can
be used as such. One of the primary design goals was to provide intrusion
analysts easy access to the tools and utilities that they already are familiar
with through a convenient web interface. As access to other libpcap tools is
desired, lightweight plugins can be written and installed without modifying
existing IDABench code. The only limitation is that the new tools must be able
to read packets that were captured using tcpdump, or some other libpcap
sniffer.

<P>Although this is not to be confused with the excellent SHADOW IDS, much of the
code is directly from, or based on, the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren
Division's SHADOW versions 1.7 and 1.8. To avoid potentially stepping on toes,
and causing great confusion, we've used IDABench (formerly ShadowIAS), and
named files and directories accordingly. Current SHADOW users should be fairly
comfortable with the basic architecture, although there have been significant
changes, some of which are which are outlined below.
<P>
<P>Right up front, the ISTS IDABench team thanks everyone who has contributed to
both IDABench and SHADOW, and especially J. Fredrick Kerby of the Naval Surface
Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division and Stephen Northcutt of the SANS Institute
for their support.  Stephen is one of the finest intrusion analysts on the
planet, and the original Shadow architect and team leader. Fred is the hand on
the wheel for NSWC/DD's IS Security section and provided sound guidance to us
right from the start. Cheers!
