<P>IDABench can survive quite nicely on fairly inexpensive equipment. There are
plenty of installations using boneyard salvaged boxes as sensor platforms. I was recently at a site
where 12 outdated, donated, desktop machines were collecting nearly 1.5GB per hour with
negligible packet loss. Storage of all that was a different matter! Consider,
at a minimum:
<PRE>
Pentium-class or SPARC-2 processor
64MB RAM
2 fast drives > 10GB, mirrored
2 server-grade network interfaces
</PRE>
<P>
<P>I personally recommend inexpensive server-class systems for sensors. Places
that you shouldn't skimp are network interfaces and reliable storage. The
additional expense of a pair of mirrored drives is a drop in the bucket
when the you consider the alternative.  :-(
<P>
<P>Sensor system (one of ours here at ISTS):
<P>
<UL>
<LI> IBM E-server x300 1U-rackmount</LI>
<LI> PIII-1GHz</LI>
<LI> 256MB PC100 RAM</LI>
<LI> (2) IBM Deskstar 82GB 7200RPM ATA/100 in software RAID-1 (overkill!)</LI>
<LI> (2) Intel 82557 Ether Express Pro 100 interfaces (on-board)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="analyzerhardware"></A> Analyzer</H3>

<P>The IDABench analyzer is a workhorse. Plain and simple, the more hardware you
can throw at it, the better its performance will be. The minimum depends on
the volume of traffic you are monitoring.
<P>
<P>Monitoring two T-1 served networks at an average of 40% utilization and three sensors, we
achieve acceptable performance using the following inexpensive analyzer setup:
<UL>
<LI> Single Pentium III 1.5GHz processor</LI>
<LI> 256MB RDRAM</LI>
<LI> 256MB linux swap partition</LI>
<LI> 73GB IDE for packet data and website storage</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Using a snaplen of 128 on the two main sensor sites and a snaplen of 1514 on a low
traffic third, we collect between 500MB and 1GB per day. Depending on the
capacity and utilization of the network segments your sensors are monitoring,
you could see considerably more.
<P>
<P>On the other hand, my home network is being served very nicely by a Cyrix P120+
firewall/proxy/sensor system with 64MB of RAM and a very meager disk. The
analyzer is my nice fat Athlon desktop workstation and I can tear through a
month's worth of data in the time it takes to brew a pot of coffee. YMMV.

<P>There are a number of dependencies that need to be fulfilled to achieve a
working sensor; most modern Linux distributions, and many other Unix-like
operating systems, ship with the necessary components. These are:

tcpdump                 http://www.tcpdump.org, http://ee.lbl.gov
Perl 5x                 http://www.perl.com, http://www.cpan.org

</PRE>
<P>sshd note:
Although the commercial SSH product is compatible, we recommend using the
open-source openssh daemon. This will avoid any potential license issues and
requires no public-key conversions before exchanging keys between analyzer and
sensor(s).
<P>
<P>Optional binaries that are handy if the sensor periodically restarts. See 
PARTIAL CAPTURES, below.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="analyzersoftware"></A> Analyzer</H3>

<P>Any Unix-like operating system is acceptable, as long as you meet the software
requirements listed below. Most modern Linux distributions come with all the
necessary pieces, many of which are installed by default. The analyzer has been
installed and tested on Redhat 7.2/8/9 with minimal massaging. If any of these
requirements are not met, the install.analyzer script will let you know.
<P>
<P>Necessary things:
<UL>
<LI> Perl 5.6.1 or newer</LI>
<LI> Perl modules: Getopt::Long, POSIX, Time::Local, Socket, IO::Handle, File::Basename, Cwd, DB_File, Digest::MD5, CGI, File::Temp</LI>
<LI> Apache httpd with mod-cgi</LI>
<LI> Secure Shell - openssh (preferred) or SSH2</LI>
<LI> crond </LI>
<LI> gzip/gunzip</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Things that will make the IDABench analyzer (and you) really happy are:
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>tcpdump - http://www.tcpdump.org 
<P>Tcpdump is historically the bedrock upon which network analysis is
built, and with good reason; tcpdump is one of the most flexible packet
analysis tools available. This release of IDABench requires tcpdump 
for the sensor, but not so for the analyzer. Without it, the tcpdump
plugin will not return any output, potentially limiting your 
capabilities, but hey, it's your data.
<P>We recommend a version other than Redhat's, but if you insist, it will
work, as long as all of your sensors and analyzers talk the same, or a
compatible version. Even though the output format is different, the
tcpdump.org CVS development versions work too, so don't be afraid to
try them out. With the "Very verbose" option in the search window
selected, your analysts get to ooh and aah at all the neato protocol
breakouts.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>ngrep - http://www.packetfactory.net <P> Jordan Ritter's "network grep"
allows you to specify regular expressions in both ascii and hexadecimal to be
matched against in the packet logs. This can be useful in identifying certain
content-specific attacks, as well as in displaying content in your output.
<P>
<P><I>Here's a trick: Configure your routers to send syslog output to a host
that isn't running a syslog daemon. Configure your sensor with a separate site
called "access-logs". Use a filter on the sensor like: "udp and port 514 and
src &lt;router&gt; and dst &lt;dummy&gt;" with a fat snaplen.  Now on the
analyzer, create a corresponding site like: &lt;IDABench
root&gt;/etc/sites/access-logs with an ngrep filter that will match on the
IPACCESSLOG and/or other strings, perhaps on certain list numbers.  Now, you
have the ability to easily correlate router/PIX events in the IDABench console,
including graphical representation (see gnuplot, below)</I>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>ethereal - http://www.ethereal.com
<P>Ethereal comes with tons of really neat goodies
that IDABench puts to use, if installed. Mergecap is, by far, far superior over
tcpslice for the merging of dumpfiles, and both the sensor(s) and analyzer
benefit from this. The sensor component can resume collecting packets if
stopped and restarted, then reassemble the partial logfiles using mergecap (or
tcpslice) before they are "fetched" by the analyzer.  On the analyzer, we can
also use mergecap for sweet returns. If an analyst wishes to have direct access
to the binary dumpfiles to dig a little deeper that she can in the web
interface, it is no longer necessary for her to have a shell account on the
analyzer system. By selecting "binary" output, the results from the many hours
of data that her query spans are merged and presented for download.  Tethereal,
or "text ethereal", is made available in the search tabs if the plugin is
present. NOTE: tethereal applies quite a lot of scrutiny to every packet before
deciding to display or discard it. This is a slow search method! The plugin is
very rough at this time; we may write a new one that offers pre-filtering with
tcpdump/snort/etc. before handing that refined dataset to tethereal. A fair
solution, for now, is to use another tool to search, then open the binary
results of that search locally using ethereal.
<P>
<P>As always, it is recommended that you compile mergecap from validated source
code, however, if you insist on using Redhat's ethereal rpm, be sure it is at
least version 0.9.11, or you'll find that mergecap isn't included.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>gnuplot - http://www.gnuplot.info
<P>View the results of your queries graphically. Need I say more?
<P>
</LI>
<LI>tcpslice - http://www.tcpdump.org/related 
<P>See the discussion about mergecap in the ethereal section, above. Tcpslice will
do the job of merging partial dumpfiles, albeit less elegantly, if you don't
like mergecap. We highly recommend that you use a tcpslice that is linked
against the same version of libpcap that the sensor uses.  If file merging is
failing, please upgrade your tcpslice before posting to the mailing list.
