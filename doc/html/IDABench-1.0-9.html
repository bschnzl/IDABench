<H2><A NAME="searches"></A> <A NAME="s9">9. Ad-hoc searches</A></H2>

<P>The Search utility allows an analyst to reach back in time and view network
events even if they didn't meet the criteria (filters) to be included in an
hourly report. Depending on the search plugin and output format selected,
the analyst can display the results of ad-hoc queries textually or 
graphically, or retrieve the packets that match the query as a composite 
libpcap dumpfile for further, local, examination.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="searchinterface"></A> <A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 The interface</A>
</H2>

<P>The Search interface is plugin-customized to provide access to important
capabilities of the associated utility. For instance, the ngrep search
interface provides text boxes in which you can specify regular expressions
to match against packet payload, while the tethereal search interface accepts
tethereal-specific filters. The plugin-specific interfaces that are included 
with this distribution will be discussed in "Search plugins", below. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="searchoptions"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Standard search options</A>
</H2>

<P>Not all of the following are available to all plugins, but are general enough
to be called "standard":
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Which sensor - Select the "site" whose data you wish to search

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Max output lines - Limit the number of lines of output sent to the
browser. This DOES NOT terminate the search process on the analyzer once the
limit has been reached. It merely is a safety valve to keep the analyst's
workstation from being overwhelmed by html data and has no effect on binary or
graphical output.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Host name lockup - Attempt to resolve addresses to hostnames and port
numbers to service names. The default setting for this is site specific and is
based on the $RESOLVE_NAMES setting in the associated site.ph. Here are a
couple of great reasons NOT to resolve names: 1. you may tip off an attacker
who is monitoring DNS activity, and 2. It often takes quite a long time to
resolve the myriad addresses that may show up in an extended search. Caveat
resolvor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Max packets to match per hour - If available, this will terminate the
examination of each hour's data when the specified number of packets matches
the query definition. If you are searching for low-volume events across
extended time periods, this can save quite a lot of time. A value of zero (or
blank) indicates no limit is set.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Start/End Search - Specifies the range of hourly dumpfiles through which
the query will be applied. Note that the ending hour is included in the search,
thus to only search through 1 hour of data, the "start" and "end" hours
selected must be the same. NOTE: some browsers like to occasionally ignore the
default field values that are passed to them. If your search returns no
results, check that the start/end dates and times are correct.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Search for a specific host/port/network - If available, these will build
simple bpf syntax to be passed to the underlying libpcap tool. The
<I>and/or</I> joiner will insert that Boolean operator between the field
values entered.  There are no parentheses used in this section to group query
elements.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Search with a general filter - Here you have the flexibility to compose a more
complex packet filter, including any macros, masking, mathematical operations,
etc. that you may concoct. There is a 500 character limit imposed on this 
field; you'll need to modify search.cgi if you need more than this. See the 
tcpdump(8) man page for details on bpf syntax.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Display output as - The results of your query are, by default, returned as text
in a web page. Three other formats are available: png, postscript and binary.

<UL>
<LI>png and postscript are graphic formats; idabench will return your data as
points on a graph representing the frequency of successful query matches. The
period of measure can be modified using the second/minute/hour/day menu and the
style of graph is also selectable. The first graphic format, png (portable
network graphics), is suitable for display in most modern browsers and image
viewers.  It is returned as an image in the resultant webpage and can be
bookmarked, linked to, emailed, etc. See "Repeat queries", below. The second
graphical format, Postscript, is actually a "page description language" rather
than a bitmap image file. It is useful for creating very high resolution images
suitable for publication, but is not supported by most browsers and image
editors. The postscript file is presented as a link for download (or viewing,
if you have a suitable browser plug-in installed). For graphical output,
<CODE>gnuplot(1)</CODE> must be installed on the analyzer.
</LI>
<LI>Binary output takes the resultant packets from a query match and, using
<CODE>mergecap(1)</CODE> or <CODE>tcpslice(1)</CODE>, if available, aggregates them into a new
binary dumpfile which can be downloaded to the analyst's local system for
further analysis. One of the primary benefits gained through binary downloads
is the now obviated need for analysts' shell accounts, and possibly even
<CODE>sshd</CODE>, on the IDABench analysis system. An example of use might be to query
for an interesting tcp communication, such as an IRC bot's communication with
its server, by specifying source and destination addresses, as well as binary
output format, in the tcpdump search tab, then locally using <CODE>tcptrace,
ethereal or tcpflow</CODE> to extract the conversation(s). Another possibility is to
query for all traffic to a suspected compromised system, then open the binary
dumpfile with etherape to graphically display the communication relationships
as they unfold. Ooh, pretty.
</LI>
</UL>


<P>With both graphical and binary output, the image files and merged packet logs
returned from your query are spooled locally on the webserver for a period of
time specified as <CODE>CLEAN_TIME</CODE> in <CODE>site.ph</CODE>. The names of the resultant
.png, .ps or .bin files look like gibberrish, but are actually a <CODE>md5sum(1)</CODE>
of the submitted search parameters. Every time a search form is submitted, the
<CODE>md5sum</CODE> is calculated and IDABench checks to see if someone has already
performed this same search. If so, the results are returned directly from the
cached file, instead of re-running the search.
<P>
<P>One thing to look out for, as a result of this: If the search parameters
haven't changed, but the dataset has, IDABench will NOT run the search over
again. This is a bug and will be addressed shortly. Until this is fixed, you
will need to either change something in the query (add another hour, or a
redundant bpf element), or delete the offending cached files from the spool
directory before resubmitting the form.
<P>

</H2>

<P>The search plugins included with IDABench are by no means the only ones
that are possible. As such, these notes may be rather insufficient to describe
the settings and options available to you. The three that are provided are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>tcpdump - Additional options provided with for <CODE>tcpdump(1)</CODE> deal with output
formatting.

<UL>
<LI>Choose level of detail - Allows you to pass either "-q" (quiet) or either
one or two "-v" (verbose) switches to tcpdump. 

<UL>
<LI>Quiet  - suppresses protocol information, so output lines are shorter.
This could make certain output clearer if <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> is trying to print
details of a particular transport or application protocol, merely because of a
certain port number. For instance, an attacker is communicating with his remote
administration backdoor on port 12345, using a source port of 53. This would
be misinterpreted as DNS traffic and printed with erroneous details.
</LI>
<LI>Verbose / Very verbose - Additional protocol analysis is performed. Be
aware, this may result in multiple lines being output for each packet reported.
Historically, ISAKMP, BGP and NetBIOS have also presented security risks in
their dissection. Use with caution.
</LI>
</UL>

</LI>
<LI>Print output in hexadecimal - Hexadecimal representation of each packet
is made available. This could reveal certain packet details that are either
misrepresented by <CODE>tcpdump</CODE>'s summary line, or not printed at all. It
may also make available patterns of binary content for correlation. "With
ASCII" prints line numbers, hex, and ASCII representation of that binary
content, side-by-side. Pretty. This option will not work with early versions of
<CODE>tcpdump(1)</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>


<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>ngrep - The ngrep plugin allows content-based searches to be specified,
and the output be formatted with a few basic modifiers:

<UL>
<LI>Search for this packet content: (regex) - A regular expression to be
searched for in the payload of all packets that match the header expression.
This expression can be in ASCII or in hexadecimal, but not a combination. If
there are multiple lines used, they are joined with either <CODE>.*</CODE> or a pipe
symbol <CODE>|</CODE>, depending on the pull-down selections "followed by" and "or",
respectively. To better understand the syntax and processing, try several
combinations and review the resultant command line that is displayed at the top
of the returned "Results" web page.
</LI>
<LI>Display Timestamp - Self explanatory.
</LI>
<LI>Print output in hexadecimal - This will output the payload as hex and
ASCII, side by side. See the discussion of hex output in the tcpdump plugin
section.
</LI>
</UL>


<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>tethereal - tethereal(1) is a text version of the wonderful protocol
analyzer, Ethereal. The syntax for specifying packets to output is very rich,
and the output itself can be overwhelming in its detail. There is a performance
price to pay for all of this capability, do use with caution.

<P>From the Tethereal manual page:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
When printing a decoded form of packets, Tethereal prints,
by default, a summary line containing the fields specified
by the preferences file (which are also the fields dis­
played in the packet list pane in Ethereal), although if
it's printing packets as it captures them, rather than
printing packets from a saved capture file, it won't print
the "frame number" field.  If the -V flag is specified, it
prints instead a protocol tree, showing all the fields of
all protocols in the packet.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>See <CODE>man 1 tethereal</CODE> for a full description of the read filter syntax. A
few examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>ip.addr eq 10.2.3.4</CODE> - either ip address equals 10.2.3.4
</LI>
<LI><CODE>ip.src ne 192.168.46.2</CODE> - source ip address is not equal to 192.168.46.2
</LI>
<LI><CODE>tcp.port ne 22</CODE> - EITHER tcp source port or destination port isn't equal
to 22
</LI>
<LI><CODE>! tcp.port eq 22</CODE> - NEITHER tcp source port not destination port is equal
to 22
</LI>
<LI><CODE>aim.channel eq 2 and ip.addr eq dhcp69</CODE> - AOL Instant Messenger
channel 2 and ip host dhcp.69
</LI>
<LI><CODE>aim[17:9] == 61.6c.70.69.6e.69.73.74.61</CODE> - AOL IM Screen name is
"alpinista"
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The tethereal search plugin is a very simple one that can be used as an example
of plugin design; hopefully there will be a friendlier IDABench interface
to tethereal soon.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="repeatqueries"></A> <A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Repeat queries</A>
</H2>

<P>If a query is submitted that is identical to a prior query,
and the image or composite binary dumpfile is still in the web spool
directory, the query will NOT be reprocessed.  Instead, the cached results will
be returned to the browser immediately. This allows one to bookmark or email
the URL of a "results" webpage containing an image or postscript or binary
results link.  These spooled files will be flushed once the
IDABENCH_TEMP_FILE_LIFESPAN (in idabench.conf) has been surpassed.
