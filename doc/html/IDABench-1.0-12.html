<P>The history of IDABench and the original SHADOW Intrusion Detection System
dates back to a collaborative effort between the Naval Surface Warfare Center,
Dahlgren Division and the SANS Institute that started in early 1998. The
original development team of Stephen Northcutt, Vicky Irwin and Bill Ralph laid
foundations that have been built upon by many, many other dedicated users,
reviewers and contributors. 
<P>
<P>I invite you to read the documentation we have included in the docs/historical
directory for a better grounding in NSWC/DD SHADOW's pedigree.
<P>
<P>I have tried to include, here, a list of all those who, either directly or
indirectly, played a part in Shadow and/or IDABench. If I have omitted anyone,
it was due to none other than my own ignorance, and I offer my sincere apologies
as well as an invitation to contact the Dartmouth ISTS team so that we can
rectify the oversight.
<P>
<P>First, thanks go out to those whose progamming skills have built SHADOW and/or
IDABench:
