<P>IDABench looks for plugins in the directory designated by IDABENCH_LIB_PLUGIN_PATH
in the idabench.conf file.  Plugins are written in Perl.  Hourly analysis
plugins should have the extension .ph, and search plugins the extension .se.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Hourly Analysis Plugins</A>
</H2>

<P>These plugins consist of two parts, the plugin definition files and rule files.
A plugin definition file ends with extension .ph and defines the plugin for
all sensor sites.  However, the plugin will only be active for sites which
have rule files for that plugin.  For example, there is an ngrep plugin named
ngrep.ph in directory IDABENCH_LIB_PLUGIN_PATH.  If there are two sensor sites,
NorthGate and SouthGate, IDABench will look in directories
<CODE>IDABENCH_SITE_PATH/NorthGate/ngrep</CODE> and  <CODE>IDABENCH_SITE_PATH/SouthGate/ngrep</CODE> for
rule files, which may have any name.  For each site, in each hour, IDABench will
call ngrep once with each rule file, then concatenate the output and process
it in aggregate.  The resulting output will be appended to the web page
generated for that hour's data.  The meaning of a rule file is up to the
specific tool - it can contain any parameters the tool needs, allowing the
action of the plugin to be site-specific.
<P>
<P>A plugin definition file must define the following four Perl variables: $head,
$color, $individual, and $aggregate.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$head is the string to be displayed on the web page in order to introduce the
output from the plugin.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$color is the background color to use in that section of the report.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$individual is a Perl subroutine that takes two arguments: the name of a rule
file and the name of an output file.  The routine must return a string which
will be called to invoke the tool on input from stdin, and send the output to
the output file.  The subroutine may make use of parameters in the
idabench.conf file, by prefixing them with the namespace IDABENCH, as in
$IDABENCH::TCPDUMP_CMD.  The $individual subroutine will be executed on each
rule file found for a given site, in alphabetical order.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$aggregate is a Perl subroutine that takes a single argument: the name of a
file containing the concatenated output from all the invocations of
$individual.  The subroutine should take its input from this file and write to
stdout, in a form suitable for display in the html file.  The output will
appear between &lt;PRE> and &lt;/PRE> tags.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>To summarize, each time raw tcpdump files are pulled from sensor sites, IDABench
will look for hourly analysis plugins that have associated rule files.  For
each rule file found, it will call $individual to build a process, and then
pipe tcpdump packet data through these processes, concatenating the results
into a file.  Then it will call $aggregate on this file, and append the output
to the hourly web page.  It will do this for each plugin, in alphabetical
order, preceding each one with $head, and coloring the output using $color.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 Search plugins</A>
</H2>

<P>These plugins allow you to add new search and analysis tools to IDABench.  They
appear as new search forms which can specify ranges of data to process and
produce a web page displaying the results.  There is quite a lot involved, as
the form must be specified and displayed, data gathered and validated, the
correct span of data processed, and the output formatted for display.  We have
attempted to factor out the common work, so you can concentrate on what is
unique to your tool.
<P>
<P>The plugin should be placed in a file in the directory indicated by
IDABENCH_LIB_PLUGIN_PATH.  The file should have extension .se.  The part of the
file name before the extension will be used as the name of the plugin (see
tcpdump, ngrep, and tethereal for examples).  Links to the plugin forms will
appear in alphabetical order on the IDABench Search Tools page.
<P>
<P>A search plugin must define one string, $heading, and five subroutines,
build_form_table, plugin_validation, build_search_command,
transform_plugin_line, and answer_heading.  Any of these may make use of
variables defined in idabench.conf directly; it is not necessary to prepend
the IDABENCH namespace as it is for hourly analysis plugins.  They may also
define and share global variables, so long as these do not conflict with
variables in search.cgi.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><P>
</LI>
<LI>$heading is used as the title of the output page.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>build_form_table() returns a list of all fields to appear in the search form.
Each field is a hash containing some required and some optional values that
define the field.  The fields will appear on the form in the order they are
defined.  When the form is submitted, each field will be validated according
to criteria specified in the table.  If all fields are valid, then a Perl
variable is created for each field, containing the value submitted.  These
values are accessible to . . .

<P>
</LI>
<LI>plugin_validation() which performs any additonal validation which cannot be
specified in the form table.  It should increment the variable $aborted if
errors are found.  Any information for the user should be printed to stdout.
If there are no errors . . .

<P>
</LI>
<LI>build_search_command() will be executed.  This subroutine uses variables from
the form to build a command to run the tool, which it should return as a
string.  This command will be executed repeatedly to process each hour's data
that is within the selected range.  Normally the tcpdump data will be piped to
the command as stdin, and the tool should send its output to stdout.  Some
tools require an input file, rather than stdin, however.  At present these
tools can only be accomodated if they can handle a gzipped tcpdump file.  To
use file input instead of stdin, the plugin definition file should set the
global variable $takes_file to 1.  This will cause the input file name to be
appended to the end of the command line each time the command is run.  For
example, the plugin for tethereal contains the following lines:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 $takes_file = 1;
    my $barepattern = $teth_pat;
    our $pattern = "\'$barepattern\'";
   my $lookup = ($nslookup eq "Yes") ? "" : "-n";
   my $cmdline = "$TETHEREAL_CMD $lookup -t ad -R $pattern -r";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The -r option tells tethereal to expect a file name next, and search.cgi will
append this name before executing the command.  Tethereal is capable of
determining that the file is gzipped and handling it appropriately.  $teth_pat
and $nslookup come from form fields named teth_pat and nslookup, respectively.
In this case, the subroutine declares $pattern to be "our", so it can be
accessed by . . .
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>answer_heading()  This returns a list of html text to be displayed before the
output from the search tool.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>transform_plugin_line() is applied to every line of output from the search
command.  It should transform its input into a form suitable for display, by
altering the string itself, not by returning another string.  It should remove
the newline, at least, and you may want to entirely eliminate lines that are
extraneous to the analyst.  Search.cgi will take care of escaping &lt; and >, so
that html tags cannot find their way into the page unescaped.  In the case of
output that is destined for graphing, each line must begin with a time stamp
of a specific format:  yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.  transform_plugin_line() may need
to transform the timestamp produced by the search tool to fit this format.
Search.cgi knows to generate a graph when the form element "output_type"
exists, and has any value other than "html" or "binary".</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 Search Form Details</A>
</H2>

<P>As mentioned above, build_form_table must return a list of all the fields that
are to appear in the form.  Some of these fields, the ones unique to your
form, will need to be specified from scratch, but several functions have been
provided to define parts of a search form that will frequently appear.
<P>
<P>First, let's look at some sample fields.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    nslookup => {
          spacing => "4",
           param_label => "Host Name Lookup: ",
           maxlen => "3",
           param_type => "radio",
           values => ["Yes", "No"],
           default_value => "No",
          }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
          
<P>
<P>This field is named nslookup.  After the form is submitted and evaluated,
$nslookup will contain the value submitted.  Since it has param_type radio, it
will appear as a radio button with values Yes and No, after the label Host
Name Lookup:.  Four spaces will be inserted between nslookup and the previous
field.  When the form first appears, the No button will be checked.  When the
form is submitted, only the values Yes and No will be accepted as valid.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   
   teth_pat => {
            new => "block",
            required => "oneof",
            param_label=>" Tethereal search pattern: ",
            field_size => "70",
            maxlen => "200",
            param_type => "string",
            validity_string => "A-Za-z0-9()\-_ ,.;:$[]&lt;>=\!&amp;",
          }
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Because it is of param_type string, the teth_pat field will appear as a text
input field.  It will be 70 characters wide, but will allow up to 200
characters to be entered and validated.  Only characters in the
validity_string will be allowed.  At least one of the fields with required =>
"oneof" must have a value.  Because it is a new block, it will start a new
section of the form.
<P>
<P>Here is the complete list of meaningful parameters:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>param_type (required) can have values "string", "number", "popup", "radio",
or "hidden".
</LI>
<LI>param_label (optional) will appear to the left of the input field.
</LI>
<LI>maxlen (required) is the maximum number of characters in the submitted value.
</LI>
<LI>field_size (required for number and string) sets the displayed field width.
</LI>
<LI>values (required for radio and popup) sets the permissable values for these
fields.
</LI>
<LI>labels (optional for popup) gives visible names for each of the values in the
popup menu.
</LI>
<LI>validity_string (required for string) lists the acceptable characters.
</LI>
<LI>required (optional) can be "yes" if the field must always have a value, or
"oneof", if at least one of the fields so labelled must have a value.
</LI>
<LI>new (optional) can be "line" to put the field on a new line, or "block" to
put it in a new block.
</LI>
<LI>bgcolor (only meaningful with new block) specifies the background color for
the new block
</LI>
<LI>blockname (only meaningful with new block) is the visible heading for the
block.
</LI>
<LI>spacing (optional) inserts the specified number of &amp;nbsp; 
(non-breaking spaces) before the field.
</LI>
<LI>default_value (optional) sets initial value.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The following functions may be included to create some common blocks of fields:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>choose_host() provides fields to select the sensor site, whether to look up
the host name or not, and how many lines to limit the output to.  If your tool
does not support a host name lookup parameter, you may need to duplicate this
functionality, minus the host name lookup.  Every plugin must supply a "site"
field.
</LI>
<LI>choose_time() allows a range of hours to be specified.  These fields are
essential for the functioning of search.
</LI>
<LI>choose_tcpdump() allows tcpdump-style filters to be specified.  It may be
useful for other tools that support Berkely packet filters.
</LI>
<LI>choose_tcpdum_mods() defines "verbose" and "hexa", to provide options for
verbosity and hexadecimal output.
</LI>
<LI>choose_graph() is very useful if your tool can provide output suitable for
graphing.
</LI>
<LI>choose_binary() tells your tool to write to standard output (-w -) so
that the results can be merged into a new libpcap dumpfile suitable for
download.
</LI>
<LI>choose_bingraph() provides the two previous options as a single pulldown
menu.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>To summarize, any file with the extension .se in the directory
IDABENCH_LIB_PLUGIN_PATH will be treated as a IDABench Search plugin.  Links to
the plugins will appear on every search page.  In fact, each search will be
search.cgi with the parameter tool=thepluginname in the URL.  Search.cgi will
run build_form_table() to make a list of form fields and their properties, and
will then display the form.  When the user submits this form to search.cgi, it
will use the form table and plugin_validation() to validate the user input.
If the data are valid, it will run build_search_command() to create processes
for the data, then read the proper hourly files and pipe them through these
processes, transforming the output lines using transform_plugin_line() and
displaying them as html.
