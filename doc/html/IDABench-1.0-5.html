If you are running some form of Linux, the sensor should be monitoring
interface eth0. <CODE>ps -ef</CODE> should report <CODE>tcpdump</CODE> is running. Other

<H2><A NAME="sensorinstdetails"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 More detailed sensor installation</A>
</H2>

<P>For the best understanding of what goes into an IDABench sensor , we recommend reading
the scripts and inline comments. Here is an overview of the scripts and what
the installer does:
<P>
<H3>sensor.conf</H3>

<P>This file is read by both the install_sensor and sensor_driver scripts. It 
contains locations of preferred binaries, sensor-wide parameters, and 
definitions of each sensor "site". Jump to 
<A HREF="IDABench-1.0-7.html#configsensor">Sensor config</A> for a field-by-field description.
<P>
<H3>sensor_driver.in</H3>

<P>Here's the meat and potatoes(sp?) of an IDABench sensor, the wrapper that starts
and stops the actual packet capture process and manages the resultant dumpfiles in
preparation for the analyzer(s)'s retreival. The .in version of sensor_driver 
is a template used to create the .pl version during install. <CODE>sensor_driver.pl</CODE> 
is called by the init.d script to start the sensor, and by <CODE>crond(8)</CODE> to restart it hourly.
<P>
<P>Sensor_driver.pl requires two commandline parameters, stop/start/restart and
&lt;sitename(s)>/ALL. For most installations, <CODE>sensor_driver.pl start ALL</CODE> is what
should be in the crontab. Start and restart are synonymous. In both cases, any 
existing packet capture processes for the specified "site" is stopped and a new
one is started. In earlier versions of IDABench, <CODE>sensor_driver.pl</CODE> would call 
<CODE>stop_logger</CODE>, then <CODE>start_logger</CODE> to accomplish this task. To remove the latencies
incurred during Perl's runtime compilation of <CODE>start_logger</CODE>, thus possible packet
loss, these have been incorporated into <CODE>sensor_driver.pl</CODE> as subroutines.
<P>
<H3>sensor_init.in</H3>

<P>This is a template used to create the system startup script. The only change
made to it during install is the SENSOR_PATH line. On Linux and Solaris the 
<CODE>init.d</CODE> script <CODE>sensor</CODE> is placed in the appropriate location for your system by
install_sensor and, a symbolic link is created in the <CODE>rc.X</CODE> directories. In 
FreeBSD, the script is created as <CODE>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/idabench.sh</CODE>
<P>
<H3>site0.filter</H3>

<P>See SITEx_FILTER in the Sensor config section.
<P>
<H3>install_sensor</H3>

<P>The installation script. It has been tested on various Linux distributions,
FreeBSD 5.0, and Solaris 8. Here's a summary of its actions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Read current PATH and extend it to include other likely program locations.</LI>
<LI>Use which(1) to locate executable dependencies in the extended path.</LI>
<LI>Use uname(1) to identify OS.</LI>
<LI>Read settings from sensor.conf, possibly overriding defaults and 'which'ed paths</LI>
<LI>Validate program locations.</LI>
<LI>Create installation target location.</LI>
<LI>Create user account that will own the packet capture files.</LI>
<LI>Confirm user home directory. (Solaris users, see the discussion of
SENSOR_USER_HOME, in 
<A HREF="IDABench-1.0-7.html#configsensor">Sensor config</A>)</LI>
<LI>Create a .ssh directory that will ultimately receive the analyzer user's key,
and set its mode (permissions) to 0700.</LI>
<LI>Create log directory into which all site specific directories will be placed.</LI>
<LI>Create and/or update root's crontab to restart the packet capture hourly, if 
needed.</LI>
<LI>Copy sensor_init.in to appropriate startup script location, editing SENSOR_PATH
to reflect the actual installation path.</LI>
<LI>Run chkconfig, if linux, or create symbolic link in /etc/rc2.d -> sensor if 
Solaris. This step isn't necessary in FreeBSD.</LI>
<LI>Copy all of the files in the current directory to the installation path, if not
currently there.</LI>
<LI>Set permissions on scripts to 0755</LI>
<LI>Run the init script.</LI>

</H2>

<P>Stopping the sensor is relatively simple, removing it is a bit more involved, 
as there are a fair number of moving pieces.
<P>
<H3>Stopping</H3>

<P>The startup script (possibly installed as <CODE>/etc/init.d/sensor,
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/idabench.sh, /sbin/init.d/sensor</CODE>, etc.) accepts a
commandline parameter "stop" which will kill site-specific tcpdump and gzip
processes, and merge any partial logs, if merging is available.
<P>
<PRE>
# &lt;path to startup scripts>/sensor stop
</PRE>

On many Linux distributions, you can use the <CODE>/sbin/service</CODE> script:
<PRE>
# service sensor stop
</PRE>
<P>
<P>To keep the sensor from restarting, you can either remove that script, or 
on systems that use symbolic links in <CODE>rc.X</CODE> directories (Linux, Solaris), 
remove that link.
<P>
<P>On most Linuxes, this is fairly straightforward with <CODE>chkconfig(8)</CODE>:
<PRE>
# chkconfig --del sensor
</PRE>

otherwise, you will need to:
<PRE>
# rm /etc/rc*.d/S99sensor
</PRE>

BSD variants do not use these symlinks, and require the script be removed, or
the execute permission on that script be removed:
<PRE>
# chmod -x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/idabench.sh
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Removing</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>Stop the sensor and remove the startup scripts as described above.
</LI>
<LI>Delete the sensor scripts directory and its contents, the default location is <CODE>/usr/local/idabench/sensor/</CODE>
</LI>
<LI>Delete the log directories, archiving their contents first, if desired. The default location is <CODE>/var/log/idabench</CODE>
</LI>
<LI>Edit the root user's crontab (<CODE>crontab -e</CODE>), removing the lines inserted by the installer. They are commented to ease identification.
</LI>
<LI>Remove the SENSOR_USER and their home directory. <CODE>userdel -r</CODE> should do the trick.
</LI>
