<H2><A NAME="configanalyzer"></A> <A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Analyzer config</A>
</H2>

<P>The IDABench analyzer needs to juggle quite a few programs, files, and
processes around.  As such, configuration can, at first, seem a little
daunting. The defaults for the primary configuration files, <CODE>idabench.conf</CODE>
and <CODE>site0.ph</CODE>, should serve well for most single sensor sites.
<P>
<H3>idabench.conf</H3>

<P><CODE>idabench.conf</CODE> is the system-wide analyzer configuration file. There are a
number of variables that are set here and referred to by site-specific options
later. Locations of key binaries and directories are two examples. Read through
the comments carefully as you make changes to this file, or there may be
unanticipated results. Here are a few key settings you may with to modify:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$SSH_CMD, $SCP_CMD, $GUNZIP_CMD - these are commented out by default, and
will be located during installation so that several scripts that need them can
be modified. You can, at any time, install different versions of these binaries
and specify their preferred locations here, overriding what was found during installation.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_PATH - The location where the IDABench files and directories
are located. This should be specified during installation and not modified
afterwards. Popular locations are /usr/local/idabench, /opt/idabench, home.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_HTTP_PATH - The location where the website hierarchy for IDABench
should be maintained. Subdirectories will be created here for images, cgi
scripts, global and site-specific html files, etc. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_USER - The IDABENCH_USER is the account used to retrieve data from the sensor(s), 
build web pages, and remove old files from the sensor(s). This user will 
have a crontab built for them by the install_analyzer script that runs
fetchem.pl, statistics.pl and cleanup.pl.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_WEB_USER - The webserver configuration file (httpd.conf) should say
something like: "User apache". This is the account name we need here so that
permissions can be set properly on spool directories.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_TEMP_FILE_LIFESPAN - Number of days after which to delete query
graphs and merged query files.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following are relative web paths to IDABench components. If you make any 
changes here after installation you should either re-run install_analyzer or
manually modify the webserver configuration and cgi-bin files. In other words:
make any changes you want before running install_analyzer, then don't touch 
them afterwards.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$IDABENCH_RELHTTP_PATH - Relative http path. What the base path is on the
website. If your webserver is foo.bar.net, the IDABench webpages will will be
accessible at http://foo.bar.net/$IDABENCH_RELHTTP_PATH
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_RELCGI_PATH - Relative path to the cgi scripts. See above.
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_REL_WEB_PAGES_ROOT - Where the hourly web pages will be located.
Subdirectories for each site will go in here.
</LI>
<LI>$IDABENCH_WEB_SPOOL_URL - The location of spooled graphic and binary
results from searches.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Analyzer site configuration</H3>

<P>A single IDABench analyzer can service many sensors. Each sensor instance (site)
is configured independently in its own subdirectory.  This site-specific subdir
is where you decide which plugins will be enabled and how they are individually
configured for each site. The file <CODE>site.ph</CODE> and plugin-specific subdirectories
are where this takes place.
<P>
<H3>site.ph</H3>

<P>The site.ph file is the primary configuration file for each site. It defines
sensor location, user, cleanup timing parameters, etc. As with the global
configuration file idabench.conf, the inline documentation is verbose; much of
this section is directly from those comments. If you are installing a
single-host system, no adjustments should be necessary.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$SITE - SITE is the name that the analyzer will use to refer to this source of
packet capture data. It will be used to create subdirectories under the 
analyzer directory and the web pages that IDABench creates to display the
data. It need not be the same as the sensor SITEx_NAME, but definitely should
be the same as this file's parent directory.
</LI>
<LI>$SENSOR_USER - The account name that is used on the sensor for storage of the packet capture
files. The analyzer will use this account name to ssh and scp files from the
sensor.
</LI>
<LI>$SENSOR - The name or address of the machine on which the idabench sensor is located. The
analyzer fetches the raw data from the sensor hourly via crond. If you use a
hostname, be certain that the analyzer can resolve it.
</LI>
<LI>$SENSOR_DIR - The directory on your sensor in which the raw sensor data is stored. This is 
NOT the analyzer storage path.
</LI>
<LI>$SITE_FORM_LABEL - Set the following variable to the name you want to see for this site in
cgi forms. If you leave it as $SITE, then the SITE parameter above will be
used. This field allow you to have very long, descriptive names in the
site configuration files, while still taking it easy on the analysts eye.
</LI>
<LI>$HOSTSCAN_THRESHOLD, PORTSCAN_THRESHOLD - The xSCAN_THRESHOLD settings are the number of different destination
addressess or ports that a "foreign" machine can contact before it is listed
as a possible scanner.
</LI>
<LI>$resolve_names - Should we attempt to resolve addresses to names in the hourly webpage output?
Please note that this can be a tipoff to an attacker that you are running
some kind of hourly logging process, should they be monitoring their incoming
nameserver traffic. Additionally, resolving addresses can take quite a long
time, especially if your analyzer is not connected to the outside world!
</LI>
<LI>$CLEAN_TIME - The number of days you want to keep the raw data files on your sensor's disks
before the cleanup.pl script removes them. It depends on the sizes of your
files, the amount of sensor disk space, and your personal preference.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The following settings are relative to others set throughout the system and
IDABench configuration files. The vast majority of installations will probably
not need to change anything from here down, and it is not advised that you do
so:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>ANALYZER_DIR - The directory on your analyzer machine into which the raw sensor data is 
fetched for this particular site.
</LI>
<LI>OUTPUT_WEB_DIR - The directory where web pages are created which hold the filtered data for this
one site.  
</LI>
<LI>URL_OUTPUT_DIR - The relative path from the DocumentRoot variable defined in the Apache 
configuration files to the actual html files for this site.
</LI>
<LI>SEDEFAULT - Which search plugin would you like selected by default when first opening a
new search window? This is optional and will default to the first appearing
alphabetically in the site's config directory.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Configuration subdirectories</H3>

<P>Site configuration subdirectories contain filters for each plugin you wish to
use for that site. For details on configuring plugin-specific filter files, see
the Hourly plugin filters section.
<P>
<P>During hourly processing, a separate child process is forked for each file in 
the plugins subdirectories, thus a multiprocessor system yields big payoffs in 
the analysis of large capture files.
<P>
<P>For example:

<P>
<P>Here, we have two sites configured to use different plugins and associated
filters. The first, ists, uses findscan, tcpdump and ngrep, whereas lab12 only
has two ngrep filter files. Note that the filenames are not dictated, merely
their presence in an directory with the name of the plugin.
<P>
<P>As new plugins are developed and installed, a site can be configured to use the 
new capability by adding a directory for the plugin and placing the appropriate
filter(s) therein.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="configsensor"></A> <A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Sensor config</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two primary configuration files for an IDABench sensor, sensor.conf
and a filter file, site0.filter by default.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>sensor.conf</H3>

<P><CODE>sensor.conf</CODE> contains most configuration parameters for up to 10 sensor
"sites", each with its own packet capture parameters, site name and
directories. The fields are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><P>
</LI>
<LI>SENSOR_USER -  The user account for the transfer of data between the sensor(s)
and analyzer. If it doesn't exist, it will be created during installation. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SENSOR_USER_HOME - Home directory of the SENSOR_USER. If this is not specified, it is
assumed to be /home/$SENSOR_USER. Solaris users, take note: this should probably be 
/export/home/&lt;SENSOR_USER> for you. If your system does a clean job of creating
home directories, you should NOT uncomment this.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>LOGDIR - Parent path to all site specific packet log directories. Subdirectories
will be created under this for each site that is defined below. The SENSOR_USER
owns this directory and subdirectories below it so that they can, via ssh/scp
from the analyzer, retrieve and cleanup binary dumpfiles.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SENSOR_PATH - Where to install the sensor files. This value will be used to 
modify the SENSOR_PATH entries in the sensor init script as well as the 
sensor_driver. This will override the default of /usr/local/idabench/sensor 
when running the installer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>MERGER - The installer will try to locate mergecap or tcpslice to enable merging
of partial dumpfiles. If defined here, this value will override what is found in
the path.If not defined here, or detected by the install_sensor script, the 
logbits will remain on the sensor until removed by the analyzer's "cleanup.pl".
See PARTIAL CAPTURES in README.sensor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>TZ - We need various timestamps all over the place. Set this according to your
preferences. If you have sensors crossing time zones, you might need GMT(UTC)
to simplify correlations. Otherwise, localtime (LOC) is generally convenient.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Other binaries - During installation, entries in sensor.conf override what is 
found in the path. As such, you should only uncomment the program paths and 
make changes to them if you have multiple versions of a program and are certain
of which one you prefer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Site definitions - A "site" is a running instance of tcpdump with its own unique
commandline parameters, logging to its own subdirectory. The analyzer(s) will 
refer to these sites by name when retrieving dumpfiles.

<P>There are three entries per site definition. In each one, replace the "x" below
with a site-specific digit 0-9:
<P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>SITEx_NAME - The name that is used to refer to this sniffer instance. A
subdirectory to LOGDIR will be created with this name to store its dumpfiles. A
sitename can be any combination of alphanumeric characters, but should follow
file naming conventions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>SITEx_PROGPAR - Additional parameters that will be passed to tcpdump. These
should include, at a minimum, -i &lt;interface> and -s &lt;snaplen>. Tcpdump's default
snaplen is 68 bytes, which may not be large enough to feed content-aware
analysis programs. Note that storage requirements will increase significantly
with a large snaplen. Multiple sites can certainly use the same interface.
<P>If you have modified sensor_driver sufficiently to use an
alternate pcap-based sniffer, pass any required params to it here.
<P>
<P>
</LI>
<LI>SITEx_FILTER - The file containing bpf filters to be applied during packet 
capture. These should be kept simple, as they are compiled by tcpdump at runtime
and complex filters may introduce latencies into the sensor restart chain, 
causing packet loss. You may use the same value here for all sites, if you
choose.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>sensor filter file</H3>

<P><CODE>tcpdump(8)</CODE> will read its capture filter from this file. Any network
traffic that does not match the filter defined there will not be recorded, and
will not be available for scrutiny by the analyzer(s). In cases where you have
multiple analyzers evaluating different portions of the data stream, you may
wish to configure multiple sites on the same sensor, each using their own
filter file to distribute the analyzers' loads. For example:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>web.sensor.site - (tcp and (port 80 or port 443)) or host www.mysite.net
</LI>
<LI>bgp.site.filter - (tcp and port bgp)
</LI>
<LI>everythingelse.site - ip and !(host www.mysite.net) and !(tcp and (port bgp or port 80 or port 443)
</LI>
</UL>
<P>For most sites, however, the default filter should be sufficient, simply:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>site0.filter - ip</LI>
</UL>
