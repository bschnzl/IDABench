</H2>

<P>IDABench uses a pair of installation scripts (install_sensor and
install_analyzer) to check for required and optional dependencies, prepare the
system, install the IDABench components and start the various processes.  To
install a basic one-sensor system, configuration requirements are minimal, the
majority of which can be accomplished before installation. The configuration
files, idabench.conf and sensor.conf, instruct the install utilities where to
place the components, account names to use, and most other settings. After
installation, a simple crypto key exchange will enable the sensor/analyzer
communications. If both the sensor and analyzer are to occupy the same physical
machine, although this is not recommended, one of these key exchanges is taken
care of by the analyzer installer. See the 
<A HREF="IDABench-1.0-5.html#sensorinstall">Installation</A> sections for the nitty gritty.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="modulardesign"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Modular, pluggable design</A>
</H2>

<P>IDABench was designed with customization in mind. Different analysts will want
to twist and turn their data in different ways, so we tried to make it a fairly 
simple task to modify and extend the capabilities of this workbench. There are
two primary means to this end:
<P>
<P>First, when the IDABench analyzer pulls raw tcpdump files from each sensor
site, it passes this data through analysis tools to produce hourly reports.
You can add IDABench Hourly Analysis plugin tools which will process this
stream to produce additional or alternative reports or report sections.
<P>
<P>Second, IDABench allows you to run search tools on tcpdump data from any range
of hours and view the result on a web page.  It is easy to incorporate search 
and analysis tools of your own as IDABench search plugins. Examples have been 
provided for tcpdump, ngrep, and tethereal. A uniform, table driven method of 
specifying search forms is used to create the form which will be displayed to 
analysts.  The submitted values can be validated by your plugin script and 
passed as arguments to your search tool, with the results piped to a web page 
in tabular, chart or libpcap binary form.
<P>
<P>By adding plugin capabilities, we hope to realize the following advantages:
<UL>
<LI> You can add reports and search tools without having to study a lot of
IDABench code.</LI>
<LI> Analysts can get the data they need through the web interface, reducing the
number of users who need accounts on the analysis computer.</LI>
<LI> The next release of IDABench may be easier for you to install if you have
been able to avoid editing core Shadow scripts.</LI>
<LI> Users may share and contribute plugins for future releases.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The only plugins that are shipping right now are ngrep, tcpdump, findscan
(hourly only) and tethereal (search only). You will need the associated binaries
installed to use them, though. If a site has filters configured for a plugin
that is not properly installed, the search tabs and hourly sections will appear in
the webpages, but let you know something is wrong.
<P>The Plugins section has details on writing your own hourly and search plugins.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="outputformat"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Output type and formatting</A>
</H2>

<P>The default output from IDABench is textual, presented as HTML pages served by
an httpd on the analysis system. This textual output is organized with each
plugin's output appearing in an easy to identify section. Navigation links are
provided at the top and bottom of each page for convenient movement through the
hourly output. The default search output is also text, but other output forms
are available. When a custom query is processed by a search plugin, the text is
returned to the analyst's browser with the search form reappearing at the end of
her results, pre-populated with the field selections that yielded that result.
Subsequent, modified queries are then easily entered by changing only those
fields that need to be refined to produce the next query.
<P>
<P>Search results can also be returned in either pcap binary or graphical chart
form. Binary output is a new pcap binary dumpfile containing ONLY those packets
which matched your query specification. This new, single, dumpfile is then
presented for download so that the analyst can perform follow-on analysis on his
local system, without ever needing a shell account on the IDABench analysis
machine. Tools that may be of use locally may include graphical analyzers such
as etherape, ethereal, etc.
<P>
<P>Graphical output of queries, via gnuplot, provides the analyst with a view of
the query that may reveal visual patterns of activity otherwise missed. For
example, fluctuations in the rate of a denial of service attack may provide
insight into the techniques used by the attacker. Query results can be plotted
using several different graph types, and can be scaled in packets per second, 
minute, hour or day. Be aware that counting packets per unit time across a
range of hours, days or weeks can take quite some time. Big queries require
patience as well as horsepower. There is no substitute for RAM and CPU speed.

<A HREF="IDABench-1.0-4.html#hardwarereq">Hardware Requirements</A> sections for recommendations.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sensorfeat"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Sensor</A>
</H2>

<P>The sensor component of IDABench is a pair of Perl scripts that manage packet
capture operations for later retrieval by an analyzer. It is suitable for use
alone or in conjunction with the IDABench Analyzer, which automates the
retrieval and access to this packet data.  
<P>
<P>Sensor installation is designed to be as painless as possible, allowing you to
rapidly deploy usable sensors with minimal configuration. The <CODE>install_sensor</CODE>
script and <CODE>sensor.conf</CODE> provided contain sensible defaults for most settings,
and, unless overridden by <CODE>sensor.conf</CODE> settings, will attempt to locate the
dependencies during the installation process.
<P>
<P>Previous hourly tcpdump capture mechanisms would overwrite partial hour
dumpfiles if restarted within that hour. Others would abort, rather than
overwrite. With IDABench sensor, if a dump session is aborted and then resumed
within the same hour, the partial dumpfile will be renamed and IDABench sensor
will resume capturing. At the end of the hour, these partial files will be
merged into one before the analyzer retrieves it, if either mergecap or
tcpslice is available.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="secfeat"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Security</A>
</H2>

<P>Myriad security issues have been considered, many of which pertain to the
sensor/analyzer/analyst trust model: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Few, if any, analysts will need shell accounts on the IDABench analyzer
computer, as query results can be presented to them as binary dumpfiles via
HTTP. 
</LI>
<LI> By setting the owner of the hourly sensor files to a non-privileged user, the
analyzer need not have root privileges to retrieve and manage dumpfiles on
the sensor(s).  
</LI>
<LI> User input via cgi scripts is validated robustly, and data returned from the
analysis processes is validated by the plugins (in the transform and
aggregate subroutines) before display.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>A note on system hardening</H3>

<P>IDABench does not make any efforts to harden your sensor and analyzer computer
systems. It is the responsibility of the installation team or individual to
adequately prepare these computers to operate in a potentially hostile
environment, and must recognize that the IDABench components will likely be
actively targeted by any attacker who has knowledge of their presence.  Guy
Bruneau has prepared an excellent secure SHADOW deployment package that could
be adapted to support IDABench (http://www.whitehats.ca). 
<P>
<P>Additional resources to aid in system hardening include:
Bastille Linux (http://www.bastille-linux.org),
The SANS Institute Security Reading Room (http://www.sans.org/rr), 
AusCERT Unix Security Checklist (ttp://www.auscert.org.au/render.html?cid=1920)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="filesysfeat"></A> <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 File system</A>
</H2>

<P>IDABench is self-contained in an internal file system hierarchy that generally
adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (http://www.pathname.com/fhs/). By
this, we hope that anyone wishing to install IDABench in a chroot jail will
encounter few headaches; perhaps in our spare time (hehehe) we'll have a go at
it ourselves. The IDABench root directory can be anywhere on the system by
simply specifying the target location in the <CODE>idabench.conf</CODE> file prior to
installation. The target directory will be created and all necessary components
moved into it by the install_analyzer and install_sensor scripts. Common
locations are <CODE>/usr/local/idabench</CODE> and <CODE>/opt/idabench</CODE>.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>&lt;IDABench root>/doc&gt;</CODE> directory contains specific documentation for the various
components, including a subdirectory, "historical", which holds docs specific
to the NSWC/DD SHADOW releases as well as some general analysis guidance.
<P>
<P>Analyzer configs are in <CODE>&lt;IDABench root&gt;/etc</CODE>, with a separate directory for each
"site", then separate directories in that site for each tool that you want to
use. Read the comments in <CODE>etc/idabench.conf</CODE> and
<CODE>etc/site0/site.ph</CODE>
<P>
<P>The <CODE>&lt;IDABench root&gt;/lib</CODE> directory contains shared modules, plugins, and headers
used by the various analyzer scripts.
<P>
<P><CODE>&lt;IDABench root&gt;/bin</CODE> contains the actual Perl scripts that do the bulk of the
analyzer work.
<P>
<P>The <CODE>&lt;IDABench root&gt;/var</CODE> directory contains logs, a tmp directory for certain
volatile content, and a www directory. The www contents may be installed
elsewhere on the analyzer, if desired. 
<P>
<P>Finally, the sensor, if installed, gets its own subdirectory, to easily
differentiate it in cases where both sensor and analyzer are installed on the
same machine. These single-host installations, although perfectly legitimate,
are not recommended for performance reasons.
