<H2><A NAME="analyzerinstall"></A> <A NAME="s6">6. Analyzer Installation</A></H2>

<P>Installation is designed to be as painless as possible, with minimal
configuration necessary to put up an analyzer that talks to a single sensor.
Adding additional sensor "sites" can be done either before or after
installation with little additional configuration neccessary.
<P>
<P>The "install_analyzer" script and etc/idabench.conf provided contain sensible
defaults for most settings, and, unless overridden by idabench.conf settings,
the installer will attempt to resolve dependencies when run.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="analyzerquick"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Quick install</A>
</H2>

<P>Here's the down and dirty for those who need to get an analyzer up fast. If you
wish to understand a little deeper, or just think it might be useful knowing 
what is on your machine (what a concept), jump down to The grubby details. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Extract the tarball in /tmp
</LI>
<LI>cd IDABench-1.8
</LI>
<LI>Optionally, edit etc/idabench.conf
</LI>
<LI>Run install_analyzer. You will need to be root for this step. Be sure to
read the feedback from the installer. It contains information about failed
dependencies and additional steps that may be neccessary or optional, depending
on your system or personal preferences.
</LI>
<LI>Append /home/shaias/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to sensor user's
.ssh/authorized_keys.  Don't put this in root's .ssh! That is a hole big enough
to drive a truck through! All ssh and scp is done as non-priv users. See the
sensor docs. This is done for localhost by the installer, in case you are
putting up a single-host sensor/analyzer, .
</LI>
<LI>Append the sensor's ssh host key to the analyzer IDABENCH_USER's
.ssh/known_hosts file. One easy way to do this is to become the IDABENCH_USER,
then manually ssh to the sensor as the SENSOR_USER. This should be done across
a private or trusted network, then validated manually. IF THIS IS DONE ACROSS
AN INSECURE NETWORK, A MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE CAN INTERCEPT AND HIJACK THIS KEY
EXCHANGE.  
</LI>
<LI>Edit etc/sites/&lt;yoursite>/site.ph if necessary. Pay attention to the
$SENSOR, $SENSOR_USER, and $SENSOR_DIR settings.
</LI>
<LI>Edit the variables section in
etc/sites/&lt;yoursite>/tcpdump/generic.filter, using hostnames or ip addresses
specific to your site.
</LI>
<LI>Become the IDABENCH_USER and manually run fetchem.pl with the -debug
option, then have a look at the file &lt;IDABench root&gt;/var/log/fetchem.log
for any errors.
</LI>
<LI>Point a browser at http://localhost/idabench/
</LI>
<LI>Sip champagne.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>Now, in order to get something more specific to your site(s) from the analyzer,
you will need to go into the subdirectories in etc/sites/&lt;yoursite>/ and edit
the filter files there. See tcpdump-filters, ngrep-filters and findscan-filters
in docs/ for instructions.
<P>
<P>If you can't seem to get any output, try the -debug option when running fetchem
as the IDABENCH_USER.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="analyzerinstdetails"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 The grubby details</A>
</H2>

<P>The main configuration file, idabench.conf, contains global configuration
settings that affect all sites, scripts, and resultant web pages. It is read
during installation, to determine the desired installation location as well as
the location of preferred versions of dependencies. As it is heavily commented,
please read through it carefully and adjust as necessary. The lower section,
where paths are relative to those defined above, should be left alone for the
vast majority of installations.
<P>
<P>Fetchem.pl is run on an hourly basis, as scheduled in the IDABENCH_USER's
crontab. It will read idabench.conf and determine the locations of the site
configurations. After parsing the various etc/&lt;sitename>/site.ph files, fetchem
uses ssh and scp to retrieve the most recent dumpfile from each sensor. This
ssh, as well as all of fetchem.pl's other actions, is run as the IDABENCH_USER,
thus your sensors must trust the IDABENCH_USER's ssh public key for
authentication. See the 
<A HREF="#sshkeys">Secure shell keys</A> section, below, for instructions.
<P>
<P>The sites' configuration directories are then examined for plugin filters. For
each plugin filter located, a child process is forked that will pass packet data
to the appropriate libpcap tool for analysis. Once all of the children are
alive and hungry, the hourly dumpfile is uncompressed and passed to them. Output 
from the analysis tools is placed in a temporary location, then formatted for 
display in a plugin-unique section in the hourly report for that site.
<P>
<P>If the target directories for a new site do not yet exist, fetchem.pl will create
them for you on the fly. By default, the location of all site specific
directories is the IDABENCH_RAW_DATA_PATH as defined in etc/idabench.conf.
<P>
<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>We strongly advise that you use the installation script, install.analyzer, as
there are a number of files that it edits when run. If you must manually
install, you will need to perform these edits yourself, or the analyzer will
not run. Those files can be identified by the ".in" filename extension in the 
installation package.
<P>
<P>The installation script, install_analyzer, will create all necessary
directories, user accounts, etc., but to do so, it needs to read configuration
details from the file &lt;IDABench root&gt;/etc/idabench.conf. As that file is
well commented, we'll save a few electrons and not detail the various settings
here.  Make any changes necessary, paying attention to the first 10 items.
Below them, all other settings are relative to those first 10 and should
generally be left as they are.
<P>
<P>The installer first performs a few inventories to ensure that the package is
complete, and that the necessary dependencies are present. If a failed
dependency check is critical, the installer will exit, alerting you of the
problem. If it is non-critical, the installer will include the warning in the
post-install summary. Similarly, if existing configuration files are found in
the destination directories, they will NOT be overwritten, and warnings will be
issued in the summary.
<P>
<P>A user account, the value assigned to IDABENCH_USER in idabench.conf, will be
created. This account is responsible for all of the hourly retrieval and
analysis of packet data from the sensors. If the account exists, a summary
warning will be issued after installation. A second account is necessary,
although most likely already exists: the Apache web daemon user. This account
is responsible for all ad-hoc searches and presentation of the results, as well
as the hourly web pages, to the analysts. This account should be specified in
the webserver's configuration file, httpd.conf. This file is NOT a part of the
IDABench distribution, and does not need to be edited manually, except to
enhance security. Webserver configuration is beyond the scope of this cruft.
Please see http://httpd.apache.org/security_report.html for current and past
security issues with the Apache httpd.
<P>
<P>Unless it already exists, the installer will create a public/private openssh
DSA key pair for the IDABENCH_USER for retrieving information and files from the
sensor(s), as well as executing cleanup.pl. To facilitate single-host installs,
it will then copy that public key to the IDABENCH_USER/.ssh/authorized_keys file
and set appropriate permissions.
<P>
<P>The following directories, as defined in idabench.conf, are then created (and
permissions set) in preparaion of the file copy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
    $IDABENCH_BIN_PATH,
    $IDABENCH_SITE_PATH,
    $IDABENCH_SITE_PATH/$IDABENCH_SITE_DEFAULT,
    $IDABENCH_SCRATCH_PATH,
    $IDABENCH_LOG_PATH,

    $IDABENCH_WEB_SPOOL_LOCAL
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Now that the destinations are ready, the files are modified from their original
".in" format, and written into their new homes. The following edits are
performed:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Web cgi files: The strings "IDABENCH_RELCGI_PATH" and
"IDABENCH_RELHTTP_PATH" are replaced by their legitimate values from
idabench.conf
</LI>
<LI>Many files: The value of "$IDABENCH_PATH" is added early in many files so
that they can find the configuration information at runtime.
</LI>
<LI>lib/plugins/plugins.ph: Once the path to all search plugin binaries is
determined, that information is added here to help speed things up a bit.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The webserver configuration file, httpd.conf, will also be edited. After
backing up the original file, the necessary configuration sections will be
appended to the existing configuration file, unless a IDABench section already
exists there. The webserver is then restarted and chkconfig is run to ensure
webserver restart at next system boot.
<P>
<P>Finally, any errors are summarized and a list of final warnings and additional
steps are presented as the installer exits.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sshkeys"></A> Secure Shell keys</H3>

<P>The IDABENCH_USER account will be copying several files from the sensor(s) to
the analyzer. So that this can be accomplished by the <CODE>crond(8)</CODE>, with no
user interaction, we need another form of authentication.
<P>
<P>Secure shell, whether OpenSSH or SSH2, can use a pre-distributed public
encryption key for that authentication. <CODE>install_analyzer</CODE> generates a
public/private key pair during installation for that user, if it doesn't
already exist, to be used for that authentication method. Please be sure your
sensor's <CODE>sshd(8)</CODE> is configured to allow public-key authentication. By default,
most are. What remains is two steps: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>securely making the sensor(s) aware of the user's public key:

<P>If both analyzer and sensor are using openssh, the simple way of doing this is
merely using <CODE>scp(1)</CODE> to copy the the public key to the sensor, and renaming
it (or appending it to the existing)
<CODE>/home/&lt;SENSOR_USER>/.ssh/authorized_keys</CODE>.
<P>
<P>If the sensors are using a commercial version of Secure Shell, you will first
need to export <CODE>id_dsa.pub</CODE> with the following command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ssh-keygen -ef /home/$IDABENCH_USER/.ssh/id_dsa.pub > analyzer.dsa_pubkey
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and then copy that file to the sensor's <CODE>/home/&lt;SENSOR_USER/.ssh2</CODE> directory
and append the following line to the sensor's <CODE>/home/&lt;SENSOR_USER/.ssh2/authorization</CODE> file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
key analyzer.dsa_pubkey
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Regardless of method used, all .ssh(2) files should have a permission mode of
0600, or -rw----------.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>making the analyzer aware of the sensor(s) public <I>host</I> key(s):

<P>The sensor's host key, <CODE>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub</CODE>, is used to identify
the host (not user) when an ssh session is initiated. This file will be added
to the IDABENCH_USER's <CODE>.ssh/known_hosts</CODE> file the first time ssh is
run as that user. 
<P>
<P>Once the user public key has been exchanged (above), you can then ssh to the
sensor to pass the host key. As root, <CODE>su(1)</CODE> to the IDABENCH_USER and
manually <CODE>ssh(1)</CODE> to the sensor(s). If the <CODE>SENSOR_USER</CODE>'s name is
different from the IDABENCH_USER, you will need to use the -l commandline
switch when you ssh. You may be prompted to accept the host key before
authentication takes place.
<P>
<P>Another, possibly more secure, option is to manually add a
line to known_hosts that contains the sensor hostname and/or ip address
followed by the contents of the sensor's public host key file.  See the
<CODE>sshd(8)</CODE> man pages, specifically the <CODE>SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT</CODE>
section, for a good discussion of this file.

</OL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Both of these operations should be carried out with a bit of threat
awareness.  If a public key exchange is intercepted by a "man in the middle",
substitute keys can be offered by the attacker, subverting your attempts at
secure communications. Isolated installation networks, of course, are best. If
this isn't possible because of physical distances, manual confirmation of key
fingerprints is advised after key exchanges. To help defend against future
attempts, the ssh_config option <I>StrictHostKeyChecking</I> should be set on the
analyzer.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>If you are playing mix'n'match with ssh versions and can't authenticate as the
SENSOR_USER to the sensor site(s), you may want to use Bill Stearns' wonderful
ssh-keyinstall script: http://www.stearns.org/ssh-keyinstall/
<P>
<H3>fetchem.pl</H3>

<P>If all has gone smoothly thus far, the next step should be the simplest and
most satisfying. As root, <CODE>su(1)</CODE> to the IDABENCH_USER account and manually
run <CODE>IDABENCH_BIN_PATH/fetchem.pl -debug -l site0</CODE> (or whatever
your sitename happens to be). If there is a current packet capture file on the
sensor, fetchem.pl should run and exit silently. If there are problems,
debugging output should be in IDABENCH_LOG_PATH/fetchem.log.
<P>
<P>There should now be two new files on the analyzer, the gzipped raw data file
ANALYZER_DIR/MonthDD/tcp.yyymmddhh.gz, and an hourly html report, 
IDABENCH_WEB_PAGES_PATH/site/MonthDD/yyymmddhh.html.
<P>
<P>The following example should make this a little clearer:
<P>It is currently 11:15, 25 July 2003. Using default settings for my site
configuration, I run:
