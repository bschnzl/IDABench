</H2>

<P>When IDABench retreives hourly dumpfiles from the sensor(s), if you are using
the tcpdump plugin and there are filters in the site's tcpdump directory, these
filters are passed to tcpdump to match on packet header conditions.
<P>
<P>Without using some pretty heady filter sleight-of-hand, tcpdump filters cannot
match on packet contents, merely their headers. Things like source and
destination hostname or ip address, ports, flags, options, etc. are available
for examination by specifying what to look for in the filter.
<P>
<P>A simple filter might be:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tcp and dst host www.mynet.net
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This would print out all packets containing tcp segments that are headed to
that webserver. Now, this rule will probably result in a pretty big report, if
the webserver is accessed with any regularity. It might be a little more
useful to report on packets headed for the webserver that don't look like web
requests. One basic condition that must be true, if it is normal web traffic,
is the destination port must be the well-known port for web traffic: port 80.
<P>
<P>Here's the more specific rule:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tcp and dst host www.myweb.net and (not dst port 80)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The parentheses weren't really necessary here, although they often make it
easier to read complex filters by breaking them up into logical components.
They can also be used to group elements before negation, or to aggregate
elements to be sure that tcpdump interprets the filter as you intended. For
instance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
udp and not port 53 or port 137 or port 123
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is very different from:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
udp and not (port 53 or port 137 or port 123)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>You can be very specific in what header values to match against, especially if
you tell tcpdump what bytes to examine. When looking at the actual values of
specific bytes within the headers, you can perform many different mathematical
operations on those values of contents before making a comparison. The basic
rule is this, if your expression evaluates true, the packet will be printed.
Here's what we can do with this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
src port 80 and (tcp[2:2] > 1023)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This tells tcpdump to match on two conditions. First, see if it has a source
port of 80. Then, go to the beginning of the tcp header, move down (offset) 2 
bytes and read the value of the next two bytes. If that returned value is
greater than (>) 1023, we have a match and tcpdump will display it. Since we all
know that tcp[2:2] is the destination port (see rfc793) this filter will
obviously fire on traffic going TO a web client.
<P>
<P>For more details on tcpdump filters, the tcpdump man pages are an excellent
resource, as is the SANS Institute/NSWCDD's excellent document "Intrusion
Detection -- Shadow Style, A Primer for Intrusion Detection Analysts". It is
included in the doc/historical directory in .txt and .doc formats.
<P>
<P>IDABench's tcpdump plugin has the ability to strip out comments as well as to
do simple variable substitution, making filter files easier to document, easier
to read, and considerably more portable. 
<P>
<P>Variables, if you choose to use them, are assigned one per line, beginning with
the keyword "var". They, for now, should contain a variable name followed by a
space, an equal sign, a space, and the desired value. To use a variable, simply
include the variable name prefixed with a dollar sign ($) wherever you want to
represent the assigned value. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   # variables start here
   var MYNET = 172.31.0.0/22
   var FTP = ftp.goodguys.org
   var REVPROXY = 172.31.1.6
   var PRXPORT = 33128
   # no more vars
   
   dst net $MYNET and ip[6:2] &amp; 0x1f != 0     # fragments from the outside
   icmp and not src net $MYNET                    #icmp not from the inside
   # ftp connection attempts to hosts other than the ftp server
   dst net $MYNET and dst port 21 and (tcp[13] &amp; 0x3f = 2) and !(dst host $FTP)
   dst host $REVPROXY and not dst port $PRXPORT
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>If your filters are based on organizational policy you may be able to centrally
develop filtersets so all that need be modified for different "sites" are the
values assigned, greatly simplifying filter management.
<P>
<P>TCPDUMP FILTER NOTES: The only place variables can be assigned is the beginning
of the filter file. Once the body of the filter itself begins, any further
variable assignments will be discarded. For this release, the tcpdump plugin
DOES NOT support lists of values for a single variable name.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ngrepfilters"></A> <A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 ngrep filters</A>
</H2>

<P>Ngrep filters are used for matching on both content (packet payload) and packet
header conditions. 
<P>
<P>IMPORTANT!
These rules are not a substitute for a content matching rule-based IDS. It is
trivial for an attacker to evade network grep detection, and should only be
used for reporting on events that are predictable.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Syntax:</H3>

<P>Each filter is a separate file containing two or three lines. The first line is
a regular expression used to match against the payloads of packets which match
the second line's bpf (libpcap-style filter). If a packet doesn't match the
second line, the payload isn't checked against the regex on the first line.
Comments are ignored when parsing filter lines. The third line is optional and
contains additional commandline switches that are passed to ngrep. See the
section on "Switches", below.
<P>
<P>For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
user: root
tcp and dst port 110
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This simple filter will look for POP3 authentication attempts as the root user.
To extend this a bit further, we can exclude systems from which this may be
legal:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # Robin Oot retrieves her mail from her workstation
        user: root
        tcp and (dst port 110) and not (src host robinsmachine.mydomain.org)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>        
Maybe we want to watch for a couple of different account names, perhaps
disregarding whether uppercase or lowercase in the command:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # Robin Oot retrieves her mail from her workstation
        # and Alvin D'min has an account there, too
        [Uu][Ss][Ee][Rr]: (root|[Aa]dmin)
        tcp and (dst port 110) and not (src host robinsmachine.mydomain.org)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note how using square brackets creates alternatives. These are called
"character classes", and will match anything within the brackets one
time. The pipe ("|"), or infix operator, indicates alternation; it
allows for alternate matches. Here's the logic this expression follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                U or u
                followed by
                S or s
                followed by
                E or e
                followed by
                R or r
                followed by
                :
                followed by
                (one space)
                followed by
                        (root
                        or
                                (A or a
                                followed by
                                dmin)
                        )        
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>A few specific pattern notes -</H3>

<P>A dot (".") matches any character. If you merely wish to print out all
content that matches a particular bpf, the first line need only contain
this.
<P>
<P>?, +, {, |, (, and ) are metacharacters and need to be escaped by preceding
them with a backslash ("\") if used as match characters. For instance, the
pattern: foobar? would match "fooba", "foobat", or "foobacon" as the ?
indicates an optional character. The pattern foobar\? would match "foobar?",
specifically.
<P>
<P>Have a peek at the man pages for ngrep(8) regex(7) and grep(1) for some more
details. The only book we've found that covers GNU regex is Jeffrey
Friedl's 'Mastering Regular Expressions', O'Reilly, 1997.
<P>
<H3>Switches:</H3>

<P>Ngrep is called by the ngrep.ph plugin with certain commandline switches. By
specifying additional ones here, you can modify ngrep's match and output
behavior.
<P>
<P>The switches that are used by the plugin by default are:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
t       Print a timestamp on every line
q       Be quiet. Don't report on bpf matches with a hashmark
I -     Accept packet input from STDIN as the hourly file is fed to it.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The only additional ngrep commandline switches that can be specified in the
filters are as follows. Anything other than these will be disregarded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
x       Print packet payloads as hexadecimal as well as ASCII
X       Treat the match expression as a hexadecimal string. Great for
        matching binary content
v       Invert the match. Print out content that doesn't contain the expr.
w       Treat the pattern as a word. Implies word boundaries at either end.
Anum    Print num of packets after a match is successful. Good for
        seeing follow on activity.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The order doesn't matter, EXCEPT "Anum" must be the last switch, if present.
Thus: XxA5 works as you expect it to, while A5Xx doesn't.
<P>
<P>        
A few examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# Look for Kazaa/Morpheus traffic
X-Kazaa-Username
tcp port 1214
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H2><A NAME="findscanfilters"></A> <A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 findscan filters</A>
</H2>

<P>When IDABench retreives hourly dumpfiles from the sensor(s), if you are using
the findscan plugin and there is a filter in the site's tcpdump directory, this
filter is passed to tcpdump to match on header conditions before examining the 
resultant packets for evidence of scanning.
<P>
<P>This single filter (we call it filter.getall, but you can call it anything you
want) follows the same syntax rules as tcpdump plugin filters. You probably
don't want to be too restrictive here, as scan traffic can take on many forms.
Here, I'd rather suffer from a few more false positives than to miss a targeted
reconnaissance effort; by paying attention to the ratio column in the findscan
output, an analyst can quickly identify likely false positives without having
to resort to a lengthy investigation.
