blank lines that were printed by ngrep.ph.

line.

2003-06-10 - Included the "Step-By-Step" document by permission of Stephen
Northcutt and the SANS Institute. Thanks!
Gave findscan.ph and ngrep.ph the same variable capability as tcpdump. (I
should allow for site-wide and global variable files via include statements).
Included a search field in ngrep.se and tcpdump.se to limit the number of
packets matched per hour, using the "-c" switch.

2003-06-12 - tcp_slice_dump.pl is now tolerant of broken pipes encountered when
the recieving process closes prematurely, such as when using the "-c" parameter
in tcpdump.
Replace pcaptestfile with one that claims ethernet encapsulation.
Removed nmap.cgi and its directory. Analysts shouldn't be scanning anyone from a
critical security infrastructure component. Do it from your workstation, if you
need to.

2003-06-13 - compose_IR.cgi, whois.cgi updated.
Comic art splash page removed until permission is obtained from the copyright
holders.
tools.cgi and httpd.conf modified and two new files added, indexheader.cgi and
indexfooter.html, to provide pleasing index availability in lieu of the comic.
Navy and Shadow(c) artwork removed, and Alex gave us nice logos; Thanks!
